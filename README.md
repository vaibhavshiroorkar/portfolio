# Vaibhav's Portfolio

**Hey there!**

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. I built this to showcase my journey as an engineer, highlight some of the cool projects I've been working on, and share a bit about who I am beyond the code.

I kept things simple and fast—no heavy frameworks, just pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript with some modern design touches like glassmorphism and smooth scrolling.

## What's Inside?

I wanted a site that feels clean, professional, but also a little bit "me". Here are some of the key things you'll find:

- **Clean & Modern UI**: A polished light theme with subtle silver accents and glass effects.
- **Responsive Design**: It looks great whether you're viewing it on a giant desktop monitor or your phone on the go.
- **Smooth Interactions**: Little details matter—I added scroll animations and hover effects to make navigating feel nice.
- **Optimized Performance**: Since there's no heavy bundle to download, it loads super fast. ⚡

## Built With

I stuck to the classics for this one:

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling (CSS Variables, Flexbox, & Grid)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for the interactive bits
- **Google Fonts** (Inter) for typography

## Running It Locally

Want to take a look under the hood or run it on your machine? It's straightforward:

1.  **Clone the repo:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vaibhavshiroorkar/portfolio.git
    cd portfolio
    ```

2.  **Open it up:**
    - You can just double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.
    - Or, if you prefer a local server (recommended for smoother navigation):
      ```bash
      python -m http.server 8000
      ```
      Then head over to `http://localhost:8000`

## Make It Yours

If you like this design, feel free to fork it and use it for your own portfolio! I've made it pretty easy to customize:

- **Colors**: Just pop into `index.css` and tweak the variables at the top (`:root`).
- **Content**: `index.html` is well-commented, so you can easily swap in your own text, projects, and bio.
- **New Pages**: Check out the `projects/` or `experience/` folders to see how I added detailed sub-pages.

## License

I believe in sharing knowledge. This project is open-source under the [MIT License](LICENSE), so go ahead—fork it, mod it, learn from it, or use it as a base for your own site.

If you do build something cool with it, I'd love to see it! A star ⭐ on the repo would also make my day.
